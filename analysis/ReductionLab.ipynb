    "A bias contains a grid of values added to every pixel on the CCD to ensure no negative pixel values are output. A bias value to a pixel can be likened to adjusting the y-intercept of a linear function. We expect to account for negative pixel counts because reading noise can be modeled as a Gaussian distribution with a mean of zero and some standard deviation. The read noise comes from material imperfections of the CCD. Ideally, a bias would be uniform across all CCD pixels.\n",
